## Chicago Tribune DataViz Team Job Postings

This is a place to create and share job postings for the Chicago Tribune's DataViz (formerly Graphics/NewsApps) team.

We used the [Newsapps Blog](http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/) in the past, but that's not been up-to-date in a while, so a GitHub repo seemed like a more organic way to get the posting up fast.
