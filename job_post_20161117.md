The Chicago Tribune Data Visualization team is looking for a senior news applications developer. The ideal person is a passionate visual journalist and programmer. 


Description:
=


Our team is focused on using data to tell important Chicago stories — reporting, analyzing, conceptualizing and building digital maps, charts, diagrams and applications. We study our users and develop stories that fit our newsroom’s mission as a watchdog, resource and citizen of Chicago. We play a dual role: developing stories of our own and helping with the most important stories from the newsroom.


You’ll work with our versatile team to use and develop new story forms and tools. 


Our newsroom offers a competitive salary and benefits, flexible schedule, a newsroom and management team enthusiastic about digital storytelling and creative freedom to explore the stories most important to our audience.


We're looking for someone who can nurture good ideas and find great (and technically sound) ways to execute them. We're open to new tools and ideas, but we've made some investments in our infrastructure already. Most of our utility libraries, data processing pipelines, publishing tools and web applications use Python, Flask and Node, so familiarity with that is important. 


- We like to do mapping (with ArcGIS, QGIS and leaflet)
- We like to do charting (with ai2html and d3)
- We publish with Tarbell, a Flask-based static site builder originally developed in our newsroom.
- We like to make video (with After Effects, Premier or sometimes even with straight code)
- We are the nerve-center of the newsroom’s data analysis using SQL (Postgres), Jupyter notebooks, R


Knowledge in DevOps is a big plus. Familiarity with shell scripting and *nix sysadmin tasks would be great. We use Amazon Web Services (AWS) so we’d prefer some familiarity with that platform.
