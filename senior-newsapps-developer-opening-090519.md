Position: News Applications Developer
==

The Chicago Tribune graphics team is looking for a news applications developer. This person will be a key part of a team focused on creating the digital experience of the newsroom's most important projects. 

When our team works a story we take on reporting and refining data, dreaming up visuals and hammering out the code to make a story work. Here are a few examples of the kind of thing you'd work on with us:

- How an airline crash [changed travel](https://graphics.chicagotribune.com/flight-191-anniversary/index.html)

- How we tested popular cellphones for [radiofrequency radiation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-cell-phone-radiation-testing-20190821-72qgu4nzlfda5kyuhteiieh4da-story.html)

- Sexual abuse and broken systems in [Chicago Public Schools](http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/chicago-public-schools-sexual-abuse/index.html)

- Broken promises in a [downtown neighborhood](http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/cityfront-center-kamin/index.html)

- Tracking every bullet fired by [Chicago Police](http://apps.chicagotribune.com/cpd-shootings-database/)

The ideal candidate has enough expertise in HTML/CSS/JS to utilize an ever-expanding universe of storytelling approaches and tools. Backend and DevOps experience a plus. Fluency in Python is preferred but not required.

Chicago is an incredibly dynamic news town and the Tribune is an amazing place to do journalism with impact. 

Work will be creative and intense and you'll be coding to tell stories that are important to the city, whether that is being a watchdog of powerful people and institutions, helping explain the Chicago experience and place in the world.

This position offers competitive salary and benefits and a flexible schedule.
