Background
--------------------

The Chicago Tribune Data Visualization team is looking for a lead engineer. The ideal candidate is passionate about building applications and code that make our journalism work, creating tools for experts and non-experts alike and making a framework we can use and built upon into the future.


Description
--------------------

Our team is focused on using data to tell important Chicago stories — reporting, analyzing, conceptualizing and building digital maps, charts, diagrams and applications. We study our users and tell stories that fit our newsroom’s mission as a watchdog, resource and citizen of Chicago.

Within this storytelling is a host of tools that have been developed in-house for the last 8 years and, many times, shared with the wider journalist-coder community.

The lead engineer would be central in this role, developing and expanding our toolbox, creating a sustainable DevOps environment and pushing our newsroom into areas it has yet to imagine. We are also looking for someone who can help us use technology to crack some of the city’s most important and difficult data sets.

Our newsroom offers a flexible schedule, competitive salary and benefits and a newsroom and management team enthusiastic about digital storytelling.


**Some of the skills we are looking for:**

*Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, RDS, Route 53, Cloud Search)
*Linux system administration (Ubuntu experience preferred)
*Databases, including PostgreSQL + PostGIS
*Data structure servers (we use Redis)
*Virtualization (we use Vagrant + Virtualbox)
*Python (including Django and Flask)
*Javascript, es6 and popular libraries (Node, React, D3, Backbone)
*HTML5/CSS3




We want our newsroom to look more like the city that we serve. If you’re a person from a group that’s underrepresented in engineering or journalism, we really want to see your application!
